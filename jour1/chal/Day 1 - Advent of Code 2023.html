Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on Mastodon and
@ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---</h2><p>Something
 is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a
 look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to
 mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.</p>
<p>You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all <em class="star">fifty stars</em> by December 25th.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available
 on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when 
you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>
<p>You try to ask why they can't just use a <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1">weather machine</a>
 ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") 
and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") <span title="My hope is that this abomination of a run-on sentence somehow conveys the chaos of being hastily loaded into a trebuchet.">and</span>
 hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow 
comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you 
into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet" target="_blank">trebuchet</a> ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").</p>
<p>As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been <em>amended</em>
 by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art
 skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values 
on the document.</p>
<p>The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific <em>calibration value</em> that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the <em>first digit</em> and the <em>last digit</em> (in that order) to form a single <em>two-digit number</em>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are <code>12</code>, <code>38</code>, <code>15</code>, and <code>77</code>. Adding these together produces <code><em>142</em></code>.</p>
<p>Consider your entire calibration document. <em>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>54990</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually <em>spelled out with letters</em>: <code>one</code>, <code>two</code>, <code>three</code>, <code>four</code>, <code>five</code>, <code>six</code>, <code>seven</code>, <code>eight</code>, and <code>nine</code> <em>also</em> count as valid "digits".</p>
<p>Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the calibration values are <code>29</code>, <code>83</code>, <code>13</code>, <code>24</code>, <code>42</code>, <code>14</code>, and <code>76</code>. Adding these together produces <code><em>281</em></code>.</p>
<p><em>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>54473</code>.</p><p class="day-success">Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **</p>
<p>At this point, you should <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023">return to your Advent calendar</a> and try another puzzle.</p>
<p>If you still want to see it, you can <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1/input" target="_blank">get your puzzle input</a>.</p>
